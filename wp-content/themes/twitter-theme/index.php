    <p>It has been three years since the word “selfie” officially gained status as the 2013 Oxford Dictionary word of
        the year and it’s safe to say the selfie game is stronger than ever and continues to be social media’s most
        loved form of expression. </p>
    <p>It’s probably safe to assume most selfies still happen on Instagram, where on average 80 million photos are
        uploaded and shared every day. We used the Instagram API to obtain some compelling data, which allowed us to
        search through and pull images using the “Selfie” hashtag, along with geographical coordinates from each
        state.</p>
